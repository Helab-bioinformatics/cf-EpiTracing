Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were implemented to assess the distinguishability of tissue signature-associated ICS signals among CRC, CHD, and B-cell lymphoma patients. The entire dataset (n=125 for healthy individuals, n=107 for CRC patients, n=23 for CHD patients and n=309 for B-cell lymphoma patients) was randomly partitioned into two subsets for each classification task: 80% of the samples were allocated for model training, while the remaining 20% were reserved for independent model testing. Differential analyses of tissue-signature.ICSs was conducted to identify disease-specific tissue-signatures for CRC, CHD, and lymphoma, using 342 tissue-signature.ICSs linked to the primary diseased tissues across the three disease categories. The selection process involved comparing each disease group against all other samples within the training dataset.
Separate GLMs were constructed for CRC, CHD, and lymphoma using a binomial logistic regression framework, incorporating the respective disease-specific ICS signatures identified from the training dataset. Model parameters were estimated via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), optimizing the log-likelihood function to minimize classification error.
Model performance was assessed using the independent testing dataset, which was strictly withheld from both feature selection and model training phases. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) was computed to evaluate classification effectiveness.
