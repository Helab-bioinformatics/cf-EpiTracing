XGBoost machine learning models were developed to: (1) classify CRC patients and healthy individuals, and detect early colorectal precancerous lesions (CRA); (2) assess tumor burden in CRC and CRA patients; and (3) diagnose and grade DLBCL patients at different stages. For each application, the models were designed with clear separation of training and independent validation groups. The models were trained and tuned using only the data from the training group. To optimize model performance, Bayesian optimization was employed to fine-tune key hyperparameters. The optimization process for classification models aimed to maximize the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and was conducted using 10-fold cross-validation over multiple iterations. For the regression models, optimization aimed to minimize Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) through similar cross-validation methods. 
Our models were built based on traditional XGBoost modeling structures for classification and regression. Codes provided here could be used for modeling and performance evaluation for similar applications.
Following optimization, the final models were trained on the entire training set using the best hyperparameters as follows: 

a. CRC-Healthy classification model: max_depth=10, eta=0.1092597, gamma=0.7101353, colsample_bytree=0.550724, min_child_weight=1, subsample= 0.5646262, alpha=1.575586, lambda= 0.3591162, scale_pos_weight=8.007276.  
b. Tumor burden regression model: max_depth= 11, eta=0.3, gamma=3.068117, colsample_bytree= 0.4, min_child_weight=1, subsample= 0.7009647, alpha= 18.6771, lambda= 9.16775.  
c. DLBCL score regression model: max_depth=10, eta=0.3, gamma=1.713669, colsample_bytree=0.6008154, min_child_weight=10, subsample=0.5, alpha=2.220446e-16, lambda= 2.220446e-16, scale_pos_weight=8.695007. 

KEY NOTES:
1. To evaluate the generalization capability of the CRC-Healthy classifier, it was applied to adenoma samples (CRA), which were an unseen subset of pre-cancerous data. Each CRA sample was classified as either CRC or healthy based on a 0.5 probability threshold. Samples with predicted probabilities â‰¥0.5 were considered correctly detected as CRA. Signals in 408 CRC-specific ICSs were used used for modeling.
2. Tumor size in CRC patients was clinically assessed using CT/PET-CT, while the tumor size for healthy individuals was expected to be 0. CRA patients were included in the validation group. For any predicted tumor size below 1, the value was adjusted to 0. 
3. For the DLBCL score regression model, the expected DLBCL scores for healthy individuals and patients in stages I, II, III, and IV were set to 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The Youden index was utilized to determine the optimal cutoff for DLBCL scores in the classification of training group samples, and this cutoff was subsequently applied to the validation group samples. Signals in 319 DLBCL-specific ICSs were used used for modeling.
4. Models in this study could be loaded using "xgb.load" function in R.
